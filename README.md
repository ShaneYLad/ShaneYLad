## 🚀 About Me

I'm a UK-based computing student currently studying **Level 3 IT**, with plans to pursue **cybersecurity and digital forensics** at university. I believe **privacy is a human right**, and I'm building tools, content, and services to help people. Especially vulnerable users.

My work blends **child safety**, **ethical tech**, and **privacy education**. Inspired by creators like 0day and Scammer Payback, I aim to make Sanctum a refuge for digital empowerment.
